## 📂 Project Structure

### 1. Part 1: Network Analysis & Wireshark Capture
This section focuses on protocol analysis and packet capturing.
* **Objective:** Documentation of CSV file creation and transmission over the network.
* **Wireshark Capture:** Includes a captured traffic file (`.pcapng`) analyzing the transmission of the data.
* **Analysis:** Detailed breakdown of the TCP/IP handshake and data transfer flow.

### 2. Part 2: Bank Trading System Simulation
A multi-threaded client-server application simulating a digital banking and trading environment.
* **Architecture:** Client-Server model using Python Sockets.
* **The Server (The Bank):** Manages user accounts, balances, and transaction processing.
* **The Clients:** Can connect to the bank to perform actions (check balance, transfer money, trade).
* **Constraints:** The system supports up to **5 concurrent clients** connected simultaneously.
